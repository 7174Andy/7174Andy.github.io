The project was initialized during the time when I was in a Korean web development club called Likelion US at UC San Diego. The purpose of this project is simply to make life eaiser and less time-consuming: Just one button clicked to perform a specific action. This is one of the prominant applications of computer engineering.

The website scrapes a playlist data from the Spotify playlist URL given by the user and prints out all the information (e.g. singer, title, etc.).

The website was constructed by **Django** framework in Python, and the scraping algorithms are based on **BeautifulSoup module** from Python.

This web scraping algorithm optimized the time to obtain playlist data from Spotify by 75%
