One of the important projects as a computer engineering is a full stack web development.

As my first independent project, I collaborated with two collegues to create a lost-and-found website for students enrolled in UCSD. In this small project team, I was in charge of the backend web development of the website.

For the implementation of the database, I utilized **MongoDB** to construct database schema and store data for the website. For the API, I utilized **Node.js** to construct necessary API, such as login and signin APIs, to load and store data to the database.
