Hi, I am Andrew Park. I am currently a sophomore studying _Computer Engineering_ at UC San Diego. Although my primary background is Sourth Korea, I was blended with diverse cultures: I was born in North Carolina and lived there for five years. Then, I moved to Seoul, South Korea, and lived there for another five years, and I moved to Shanghai, China. At last, I ended up here at San Diego.

# Why Computer Engineering

I started programming since I was in high school, but I am still exploring the wide world of programming with passion and longlasting dream.
