Hi, I am Andrew Park. I am currently a sophomore studying _Computer Engineering_ at UC San Diego. Although my primary background is Sourth Korea, I was blended with diverse cultures: I was born in North Carolina and lived there for five years. Then, I moved to Seoul, South Korea, and lived there for another five years, and I moved to Shanghai, China. At last, I ended up here at San Diego.

I am currently a frontend web developer at [Citmit](https://citmit.info/) where machine learning technology is utilized to help obtain permits for constructions.

I am very excited to explore through the applications of computer enginnering in different fields. Specifically, I want dive into artificial intelligence and software engineering, and I am currently seeking lab internship related to these fields.

# Why Computer Engineering?

The first time I encountered the concept of coding was when I was in middle school learning Scratch. This is when I fell in love with programming. Then, I started learning programming through AP Computer Science when I was in high school. Now, as a scollege student, I am still exploring the wide wonderland of programming with the passion of education and longlasting dream of becoming an ML engineer.
