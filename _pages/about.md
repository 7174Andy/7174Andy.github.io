Hi, I am Andrew Park. I am currently a sophomore studying _Computer Engineering_ at UC San Diego. Although my primary background is Sourth Korea, I was blended with diverse cultures: I was born in North Carolina and lived there for five years. Then, I moved to Seoul, South Korea, and lived there for another five years, and I moved to Shanghai, China. At last, I ended up here at San Diego.

I am currently a frontend web developer at [Citmit](https://citmit.info/) where machine learning technology is implemented to facilitate the process of obtaining permits for constructions.

I am very excited to explore through the applications of computer enginnering in different fields. Specifically, I want dive into artificial intelligence and software engineering, and I am currently seeking a research internship related to these fields.

# Experience

Computer engineering can be utilized in numerous diverse fields, such as bioengineering, physics, and others. Therefore, one of the most important aspect of being a successful computer engineer is to have diverse experience at different fields. I have worked as a **backend and frontend developer**, **tutor**, **software developer**, and **project leader**. These priceless experiences not only strengthened my computer engineering background but also understood how computer engineering can be applied to other fields, such as education and governmental documents.

# Why Computer Engineering?

The first time I encountered the concept of coding was when I was in middle school learning Scratch. This is when I fell in love with programming and was intrigued by coding because I can contruct whatever I want using lines of codes. The blank Java file on the screen's IDE is like a white canvas where I can draw whatever I imagine. And I chose computer engineering to solidify my imaginations and to bring them in real life.
