Hi, I am Andrew Park. I am currently a sophomore studying _Computer Engineering_ at UC San Diego. Although my primary background is Sourth Korea, I was blended with diverse cultures: I was born in North Carolina and lived there for five years. Then, I moved to Seoul, South Korea, and lived there for another five years, and I moved to Shanghai, China. At last, I ended up here at San Diego.

I am currently a frontend web developer at [Citmit](https://citmit.info/) where machine learning technology is utilized to help obtain permits for constructions.

I am very excited to explore through the applications of computer enginnering in different fields.

# Why Computer Engineering

The first time I encountered the concept of coding was when I was in middle school learning Scratch. I started programming since I was in high school, but I am still exploring the wide world of programming with passion and longlasting dream.
